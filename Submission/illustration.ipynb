    "One of the main methods proposed to suppress an increase in the number of measurements is the partitioning method, where Pauli strings are partitioned so that their expectation values can be measured simultaneously. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this method, a group of Pauli strings is divided into subgroups, and all the components of each subgroup are measured simultaneously using only one circuit (hereafter, such subgroups are called “partitions”). \n",

    "### Implementation\n",
    "The problem of Pauli string grouping can be broken down into two parts:\n",
    "1. The partition of a given group of Pauli strings.\n",
    "2. The method to get the equivalent measurement results of pauli strings in a partition from the result of the so-called \"simultaneous measurement\" \n",

    "Readout-Error Mitigation (REM) is an error mitigation technique in which inverted transition / confusion matrices are applied to the noisy measurement results.\n",
    "\n",
    "technique is based on two main ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generating a confusion matrix for a specific device;\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Computing the psuedoinverse of this confusion matrix and applying it to the raw measurement (or “readout”) results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation\n",
    "##### Measurement based method\n",
    "The readout mitigator is generated from an assignment matrix: a $2^n \\times 2^n$ matrix A such that $A_{y,x}$ is the probability to observe y given the true outcome should be x. The assignment matrix is used to compute the mitigation matrix used in the readout error mitigation process itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Correlated readout mitigator uses the full $2^n \\times 2^n$ assignment matrix, meaning it can only be used for small values of n. \n",
    "\n",
